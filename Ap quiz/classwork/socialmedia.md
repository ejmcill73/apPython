#1 Having a large social media following isnt something im really intrested in or striving for. I say this because i dont really post on social media and i also value my privacy and with a large folloeing you would have less of it. A large following could also give alot of people anxiety and make people self conscious which isnt ideal.

#2 Yes i have purchased something because of social media. I purchased an article of clothing because it felt that it look good and alot of people were wearing it at the time. The item i purchased was a hoodie from the brand Spider WorldWide.

#3 The best thing about social media to me is the fact that you could connect with many people who you wouldnt normally be friends with. I have made alot of friends using social media these people dont live close to me so social media is one of the only ways i can speak to them on the regular. Another thing i like about social media is the fact that creators on social media can show you new things that you may want to buy.

#4 Some of the worst things about social media for me is when your friends send you alot of videos or text you when you cant be on your phone at the time. 

#5 The social media app i use the most would either be Tik Tok or Instagram. I use these apps because these apps create entertaining videos. These apps also allow you to message with your friends.

#6 The longest i could go without my phone is probably a couple weeks. I say this because while i do use my phone alot i could find other things to do like use a computer or play video games. But if all electronics are off limits i might go to the library to read books.
