# 1. In your own words, describe what a function is
#a block of code which only runs when it is called

# 2. A parameter is a variable in a function definition. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value. An argument is a value passed during function invocation
# 3. write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a users name. You will need to use parameters and arguments
def welcome_user(user_name):
    print(f"Welcome, {user_name}! We're glad to have you.")

# 4. Write a function that will do a calculation that takes 3 parameters.
# Your function can do any of the arithmatic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
def calculate(num1, num2, operator )
if operator == '+':
    result= num1+ num2
elif operator =='-' :
    result= num1 - num2
elif operator =='*':
    result = num1 * num2
elif operator =='/' :
    if num2 ! = 0: 
result = num1 / num2 
else:
# 5. Write a function that will output a message to a user, telling them
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a 
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard coded data.
