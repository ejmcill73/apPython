# Contributors, Eric McGIll, Ian Kimble (Helped me with some of the code)

# Question 1, What inspired dme to work on this code was that i had lost my tv remote recently and i had to switch to an app to use my TV

# Question 2, A road block i had was that i had some errors with things like putting my code together and having them run simultaneously

# Question 3, One thing i would like to do differently is to add a little more features to my code.
