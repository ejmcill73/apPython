My program is about math and helping people get better at it. My program generates random math that gets harder gradually to help users study

My program is trying to solve the problems that students have with grasping some difficult math concepts without expensive tutors.

My program will be completely free to the public. The program would also have different levels of math that it will give you depending on what you need to learn, The program would also pace you so it would be 100% customized for your needs and wants 

A program that is similar to mine would be Iready.com i say this because it has a math section with many different forms of math to help students grasp the concepts that they need to learn, Iready also paces their users on the materials which helps them.

This program is for people who dont have the time or money for personal tutors and want to study outside of school.
